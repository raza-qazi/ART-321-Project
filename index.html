                    <p>Sauron, the dark lord, threatens to conquer Middle Earth. He possess The One Ring containing Sauron’s evil will, malice and cruelty. To stop this ancient evil, a last alliance of man and elves band together and fight to reclaim their lands. In the midst of this battle, Sauron is struck down, his evil ring taken. Over time, the location of One Ring was lost for over 3000 years, none the wiser of where it had gone. </p>

                    <event>Concerning Hobbits</event>
                    <br/>
                    <p><em>Roughly 2000 years later:</em> <br/> Following from his 111th birthday, Bilbo Baggins of The Shire gives his prized ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins. The Grey wizard, Gandalf, suspects that the ring Frodo now carries is The One Ring. He rides to Minas Tirith to confirm his suspicion by pouring over ancient scrolls and documents. Months later, he discovers how The One Ring can be identified and rushes back to The Shire to check on Frodo. If the Ring is heated by fire, marks identified as Black Speech will be written on the Ring. To confirm Gandalf’s suspicion, he orders Frodo to throw the Ring into his fireplace. The Black Speech appears confirming the Frodo’s ring is in fact The One Ring. Gandalf orders Frodo to escape Bag End immediately with the Ring along with Samwise Gamgee, who was eavesdropping the entire conversation. Gandalf rides to Isengard to warn Saruman the threat Sauron now posed, but instead finds out that Saruman has allied himself with Sauron. Saruman imprisons Gandalf, and releases Ringwraiths to find and capture Frodo.
                    </p>
                    <p>Merry and Pippin, two other Hobbits from The Shire, join Frodo and Sam. After escaping one Ring-wraith, the hobbits arrive in Bree to meet with Gandalf and instead are aided by a ranger named Strider, a friend of Gandalf, and escorts them to Rivendell instead.</p>

                    <p>The Hobbits get ambushed by Ringwraiths and Frodo gets stabbed by one of them, causing a curse to course through his body. Fearing his safety, Strider attempts to carry Frodo to Rivendell. Along the way, they discover Arwen, an elf, who comes to Frodo’s aid, cures his curse, and successfully takes him to Rivendell. </p>

                    <p>Arriving at Rivendell, Frodo meets with Gandalf who escaped Saruman’s clutches after calling a giant eagle to aid him. The group meets with Elrond, father of Arwen, and lord of the Elves. Elrond holds a council where it is decided that the Ring must be taken to Mordor to Mount Doom to get destroyed. Frodo volunteers to become the ring keeper bearing the burden of carrying the ring. It is then decided that Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, now identified as Aragorn -heir to Isildur, are to accompany Frodo on his journey. They form:</p>

                    <p>The Fellowship sets off but are forced to travel through the Mines of Moria due to Saruman’s evil magic much to Gandalf’s chagrin. Inside, they are ambushed by orcs and a cave troll. Fending them off, they travel deep within Moria and get confronted by an ancient demon named Balrog. Gandalf, fearing the group’s safety, forces them to get away from him and casts the Balrog into a vast chasm. Unfortunately, Balrog’s whip grasps Gandalf’s foot as the demon is falling and forces Gandalf to fall into the darkness with him. The Fellowship, now under Aragorn, arrive at Lothlorien homes. Aragorn quietly warns Frodo that only Frodo alone can complete the journey and warns that one of The Fellowship members will try to take the ring from him. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of orc breeds called the Uruk-Has to track and kill the Fellowship.</p>

                    <event>The Breaking of the Fellowship</event>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The Fellowship leave Lothlorien towards Earth Galen. Frodo wanders away from the group and gets confronted by Boromir who attempts to take the Ring by force. Shaken by this experience, Frodo heads off alone towards Mordor fearing his friend’s safety and the corrupting influence of the Ring. The other members of The Fellowship are ambushed by the Uruk-Hai and attempt to fend them off. Unfortunately, Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded. Aragorn watches as Boromir dies peacefully and sets off to rescue Merry and Pippin along with Gimli and Legolas. Sam decides to follow Frodo, keeping his promise to Gandalf about keeping Frodo safe. The Fellowship is now broken.</p>
